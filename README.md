# VodnikOS
A hobby Operating System project

# Target Systems

My goal is to initially target the Respberry Pi 3B and 4B. So targeting the aarch64 platform. Most of the 3B development will take place using QEMU has my test environment for changes. I will test on hardware on the 4B since that is the device I physically have.

# What this is for

It is just a simple hobby OS. I don't think anyone will get much use out of it other than for seeing how I implement some things, but this is mostly for me to broaden my learning on how computers work and playing with hardware.
